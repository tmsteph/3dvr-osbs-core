1. Introduction

1.1 What is the 3DVR OSBS?

The 3DVR Open-Source Business System (OSBS) is a decentralized, open-source framework that empowers individuals to start, own, and operate businesses collectively. It is designed to create a sustainable, transparent, and community-driven business ecosystem where employees, customers, and investors share governance, profits, and decision-making power.

1.2 Mission & Vision

Mission:

To build an open-source business infrastructure that enables anyone to invest, work, and participate in decentralized businesses with fair governance, open access, and sustainable revenue models.

Vision:

A future where business ownership is democratized, financial power is distributed, and businesses function as decentralized cooperatives instead of traditional hierarchical corporations.

2. Business Structure & Governance

2.1 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Governance

OSBS is managed by a DAO-based governance system that ensures transparency and collective decision-making.

Decisions are made through community voting, with different voting weights for employees, customers, and investors.

Governance rules are enforced using smart contracts on a blockchain (Ethereum, Solana, or Polkadot).

2.2 Stakeholders & Ownership Model

A. Investors (Supporters)

Can invest via equity-backed tokens (3DVR Tokens) or crowdfunding mechanisms.

Receive dividends & governance rights.

Can exit or sell their shares via decentralized exchanges.

B. Employees (Builders)

Employee-Owned Business Model: Employees receive equity proportional to contributions.

Work in software, hardware, marketing, support, and other roles.

Compensation: Salaries in crypto, fiat, or equity tokens.

C. Customers (Users)

Every customer is a co-owner if they subscribe or buy services.

Earns discounts & equity for participation & referrals.

Can vote on product development & company direction.

2.3 Voting & Treasury Management

1 Token = 1 Vote (with weighting rules to balance power).

Community decides fund allocations & business direction.

Treasury is managed via a multi-signature wallet controlled by elected members.

3. Revenue Model & Sustainability

3.1 Income Streams

Membership Subscriptions ($20/month per user for premium services & co-ownership).

Product Sales (3DVR CMS, software tools, open hardware products).

Open-Source Crowdfunding & Grants (NLnet, OpenAI, Linux Foundation, etc.).
